## Brief Inroduction

Hope you are doing well. Today I wanna let you know about my C-19 resource oriented solution for Durgapur which was known as Care Plus & was available on Google Play Store, during the second wave of Covid 19.

Since the situation has started worsening hour-by-hour, I thought this would be the right time to gear up.

This time we are calling it [Dgp Care](https://dgpcare.vercel.app) a part of dgpcovidresources team & it will be available across all your favourite operating systems. Since we chose to get platform independent, this time we integrated it as a progressive web app which gets installed in you android, iOS, iPadOs, Windows, Linux & macOs operating systems. None the less it is also serve as a standalone website and you can surely make use of it.

## What's new ?

From our previous experience on the same, weâ€™ve learned a lot and we have tried our best to implement those to build a cosistent, simple, intuitive & a user centric service.
